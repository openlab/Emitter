            <h1>About</h1>
            <br><p>Emitter.ca is a product of love and labor by an A-team of open data and environment activists across Canada: David, Nik, Matt, Aaron, Mark and Barranger.</p>
			<p>What started as a car-ride conversation between David Eaves and Nik Garkusha about transformative power of Open Data mash-ups, quickly turned into a viable project with the expert data crunching by Matthew Dance. Just a couple of weeks later it came to life as an app with professional development by Aaron McGowan and project management by Mak Arteaga.</p>
			<p>The project found its home at the Microsoft Canada's <a href="http://www.port25.ca/" title="Microsoft Port 25">Port25.ca Open Lab</a>, where we pooled our collective efforts, coordinated across 3 time zones and used a "mish-mash" of Open Source (<a href="http://php.iis.net" title="PHP on IIS">PHP</a>, <a href="http://ogdisdk.cloudapp.net/" title="OGDI">OGDI</a>), cloud (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsazure" title="Windows Azure">Windows Azure</a>), and MS web platform (<a href="http://www.bing.ca/" title="BING">BING</a>, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/web/" title="WebPI">WebPI</a>, <a href="http://www.iis.net/" title="IIS">IIS7.5</a>, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/sqlserver" title="SQL Server">SQL Server</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2008">Windows Server 2008</a>) to bring the app from back-of-the-napkin concept to live beta in under 1 month.</p>
